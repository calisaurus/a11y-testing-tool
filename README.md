# a11y-testing-tool
An automated accessibility testing tool based on the WCAG 2.0 guidelines

# Product requirements
This tool will:
- Allow users to accurately assess their web products for accessibility against the WCAG 2.0 Guidelines to (at least) the AA standard.
- Allow users to run from the command line
- Inform users of a pass :white_check_mark:, fail :negative_squared_cross_mark: or near-pass :warning: for each guideline
- Be browser-agnostic
- Be language-specific (HTML/JS)
- Provide users with clear, easy-to-read reports

# Current market analysis
Whilst there are many tools out there already for accessing accessibility, most are seemingly technology agnostic but platform-dependent. In my experience, this has created many one-size-fits-all solutions that don't seem to actually fit all that well.

Some tools are great at providing users a wealth of information about failures, but can be difficult to use; whilst other tools can be really easy to use, but don't give accurate reports on passes and failures.
